# Departure Board

A tiny Python script that uses the [Huxley2](https://huxley2.azurewebsites.net)
API to display upcoming rail departures for a given railway station in the UK.

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 nationalrail.py
```

### Note

The script defaults to showing Woking, the author's home town.
